# Project Overview

## What is Replus
- A simple, modern workout logger IOS app.

## My previous experience
- Have experience in Kotlin Android app development.
- No experience in IOS development.
- Resources:
    - Apple Dev Tutorials
    - Youtube

## Why V3?
- I heavily relied on generative ai for the first 2 versions.
    - Which lead to poor code quality and low understanding.
- I aim to not use gen ai for this version.
