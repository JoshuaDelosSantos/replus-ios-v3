# Main Points
- Had a couple of issues.
- Studied using youtube and documentation to learn more about the problems. 

# Issues:
## Issue #1
**Unable to show add or edit sheet.**
- When both/or (Add/Rename)buttons are pressed no sheet presents.
- For this problem, I was using 2 .sheet() calls.
**FIX: Used an enum class to be able to dynamically call which sheet is needed with 1 .sheet() call.**

## Issue #2
**It seems that the session object is not being passed into the EditSessionView sheet properly**

Current workflow:
- Edit button toggles edit mode.
- When edit mode is true, rename button appears next to each session in the session list.
- When the rename button is pressed, the session is then copied into the struct variable selectedSession.
- The sheet is then triggered with the appropriate enum class.
- The sheet class the EditSessionView() with, and we pass in the selectedSession variable.

- Tried passing in session id instead. Didn't work.

**FIX:**
- Since we are passing the instance of the viewModel.
- Created a viewModel function that sets a published variable 'selectedSession'.
    - This method is called when that rename button is pressed in SessionListView.
    
## Issue #3
