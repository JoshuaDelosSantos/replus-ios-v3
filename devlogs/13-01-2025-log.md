# Main Points
- Created private functions in SessionListView.
    - A function that marks a session using a session id and stores it in the viewModel.
    - A function that deletes the marked session in the viewModel.
    - A function that determines if there is a marked session in the viewModel.

# Issues:

## Issue #1
**View is not updating when delete button in edit mode is pressed.**
- The swipe to delete works.
- Edit mode delete button:
    - Delete's the session from coredatabase properly.
    - But the view crashes.
    - Crash report states = 'implicitly unwrapped optional in SessionListView.swift at line 102.'

Code:
```
    private func displayRenameButton(session: Session) -> some View {
        Button(action: {
            print("SessionListView: Rename button pressed")  // Log
>>>         viewModel.selectSession(id: session.id!)  
            print("SessionListView: Session to update = \(String(describing: session.name))")  // Log
            
            sheetConfig = .edit
            toggleEditMode()
        }) {
            Image(systemName: "pencil")
                .foregroundColor(.blue)
                .imageScale(.large)
        }
    }
```
- Which is my renameButton that is next to the delete button, which is tied to the cardView.
    
## Issue #2
**In edit mode, rename button is not recognised when pressed**
- When in edit mode and I try to press the rename button.
- It calls delete functionality instead.
