# Main Points
- Refactor SessionListView to implement add session functionality as a sheet.
- In AddSessionView:
    - After adding a session, the sheet does not close.
        - Added code that dismisses the sheet after adding.
    - When returning to SessionListView, the sessions are not updated.
        - Could it be because, both files are using different viewModel instances?
        - Initialised viewModel in ContentView.swift
        - That seems to have solved the problem.
- Extracted view components into a private function in SessionListView.
- Created EditSessionView.
- Created code for editing functionality.
- Added code for updating session in SessionViewModel.
- Now having trouble with showing sheets dynamically for both adding and editing.
